This is a C program that uses an array data structure to implement basic stack operations. This program allows the user to push items onto the stack, remove items from the stack, and view the contents of the stack. The program uses a menu-driven approach to allow the user to select the desired operation.
The main function initializes the stack and presents the menu to the user. The push function adds an element to the top of the stack and the pop function removes an element from the top of the stack. The display function prints the contents of the stack to the screen.
Overall, this program provides a basic implementation of stack data structures in C.
