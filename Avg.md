This is a C program that calculates the average of a series of integer values entered by the user. The program uses an array to store integer values 
and a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of the values. The program then calculates the average by dividing the sum by the number of values
and returns the result.
The main function asks the user for the number of items to enter, reads the user's input, and uses a loop to ask the user to enter each integer value 
and store it in the marker array. The loop also calculates the sum of the entered values. After the loop, the program calculates the average by dividing the sum by 
the number of values ​​and storing the result in the variable average. Finally, the program prints the average value with two decimal places to the console.
